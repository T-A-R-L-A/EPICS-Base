<h1 style="text-align: center">EPICS Base R3.15.2: Known Problems</h1>

<p>Any patch files linked below should be applied at the root of the
base-3.15.2 tree. Download them, then use the GNU Patch program as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><pre>% <b>cd <i>/path/to/</i>base-3.15.2</b>
% <b>patch -p0 &lt; <i>/path/to/</i>file.patch</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>The following significant problems have been reported with this
version of EPICS Base:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Parallel builds ("make -j") on native Windows are not working properly.
    Builds tend to hang (make saturating one core) - interrupting and calling make
    again usually finishes the build. Sequential builds work and are recommended
    for automated build environments.</li>

  <li>64-bit Windows builds of the CAS library may not work with some compilers.
    The code in <tt>src/legacy/gdd</tt> is currently incompatible with the LLP64
    model that Windows uses for its 64-bit ABI.</li>

</ul>
